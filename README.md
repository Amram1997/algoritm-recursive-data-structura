### Recursion

#### Data structure and algorithm

---

1.Write a recursive function to determine whether all digits of the number are odd or not.

[Solution](./recursiveOdd.js)

---

2.Given an array of numbers. Write a recursive function to find its minimal positive
element. (if such element does not exist, return -1).

[Solution](./minimalPositive.js)

---

3.Given an array of numbers which is almost sorted in ascending order. Find the index
where sorting order is violated.

[Solution](./ascendingOrder.js)

---

4.Given an array. Write a recursive function that removes the first element and returns the
given array. (without using arr.shift())

[Solution](./removeFirstElement.js)

---

5.Given an array of nested arrays. Write a recursive function that flattens it. (Hint create
function that concats arrays).

[Solution](./flattens.js)

---

6.Given an array and a number N. Write a recursive function that rotates an array N
places to the left. (Hint: to add element to the beginning use arr.unshift()).

[Solution](./rotateArray.js)

---

7.Given a number. Write a function that calculates its sum of the digits and if that sum has
more than 1 digit find the sum of digits of that number. Repeat that process if needed
and return the result.

[Solution](./sumDigits.js)
